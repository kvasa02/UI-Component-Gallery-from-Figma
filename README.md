## How I Work from Figma as a Developer

- I inspect design elements in Figma for size, color, font, and states using the Inspect panel.
- I export or reference Figmaâ€™s color codes, font families, and spacing.
- I map the visual structure to semantic HTML and Bootstrap classes, using custom CSS as needed.
- I ensure each component is accessible: ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, contrast, and logical order.
- I test with keyboards, screen readers, and adjust as needed for best UX.
- I document my process with code comments and README notes.
