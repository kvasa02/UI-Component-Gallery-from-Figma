## How I Work from Figma as a Developer

When working from a Figma file, I:
- Inspect the component’s layout, spacing, typography, and states using Figma’s Inspect panel.
- Export or note color codes, font families, and sizes.
- Reference interaction notes and variants for focus, hover, and active states.
- Translate Figma’s visual structure into semantic HTML and Bootstrap classes.
- Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- Use ARIA attributes and test color contrast.
- Iterate on the code until the output matches the Figma spec, then test on multiple devices.
